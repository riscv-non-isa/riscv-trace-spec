[[dataTracePackets]]
== Data Trace Encoder Output Packets

Data trace packets must be differentiated from instruction trace
packets, and the means by which this is accomplished is dependent on the
trace transport infrastructure. Several possibilities exist: One option
is for instruction and data trace to be issued using different IDs (for
example, if using ATB transport, different *ATID* values).
Alternatively, an additional field as part of the packet encapsulation
can be used (Siemens uses a 2-bit *msg_type* field to differentiate
different trace types from the same source).

By default, all data trace packets include both address and data.
However, provision is made for run-time configuration options to exclude
either the address or the data, in order to minimize trace bandwidth.
For example, if filtering has been configured to only trace from a
specific data access address there is no need to report the address in
the trace. Alternatively, the user may want to know which locations are
accessed but not care about the data value. Information about whether
address or data are omitted is not encoded in the packets themselves as
it does not change dynamically, and to do so would reduce encoding
efficiency. The run-time configuration should be reported in the Format
3, subformat 3 support packet (see <<sec:format33>>). The following sections include examples for all three cases.

As outlined in <<sec:DataInterfaceRequirements>>, two different signaling protocols between the RISC-V hart and the encoder are supported: _unified_ and _split_. Accordingly, both unified and split trace packets are defined.

[NOTE]
====
In the following tables, "clog2" is an abbreviation for "ceiling
of log2".

[NOTE]
====
The packets described in this section do not support data trace for harts that support the Zcmp, Vector or Zacas extensions, and are deprecated in favour of the packets defined in the MMA/CAS extension (see <<sec:ext-mmacas>>)

[[sec:data-loadstore]]
=== Load and Store

[[sec:loadstore-format]]
==== format field

Types of data trace packets are differentiated by the *format* field.
This field is 2 bits wide if only unified loads and stores are
supported, or 3 bits otherwise.

Unified loads and split load request phase share the same code because
the encoder will support one or the other, indicated by a discoverable
parameter.

Data accesses aligned to their size (e.g. 32-bit loads aligned to 32-bit
word boundaries) are expected to be commonplace, and in such cases,
encoding efficiency can be improved by not reporting the redundant LSBs
of the address.

[[sec:loadstore-size]]
==== size field

The width of this field is 2 bits if max size is 64-bits (_data_width_p_
< 128), 3 bits if wider.

[[sec:loadstore-diff]]
==== diff field

Unlike instruction trace, compression options for data trace are
somewhat limited. Following a synchronization instruction trace packet,
the first data trace packet for a given access size must include the
full (unencoded) data access address. Thereafter, the address may be
reported differentially (i.e. address of this data access, minus the
address of the previous data access of the same size).

Similarly, following a synchronization instruction trace packet, the
first data trace packet for a given access size must include the full
(unencoded) data value. Beyond this, data may be encoded or unencoded
depending on whichever results in the most efficient represenation.
Implementors may chose to offer one of XOR or differential compression,
or both. XOR compression will be simpler to implement, and avoids the
need for performing subtraction of large values.

If only one data compression type is offered, the *diff* field can be 1
bit wide rather than 2 for <<tab:te_datadx0y2>>.

[[sec:loadstore-datalen]]
==== data_len field

However the data is compressed, upper bytes that are all the same value
do not need to be included in the packet; the decoder can recreate the
full-width value by sign extending from the most significant received
bit. In cases where *data* is not the final field in the packet, the
width of *data* is indicated by this field.

[[sec:data-atomic]]
=== Atomic

[[sec:atomic-size]]
==== size field

Strictly, *size* could be just one bit as atomics are currently either
32 or 64 bits. Defining as per regular loads and stores provisions for
future extensions (proprietary or otherwise) that support smaller
atomics.
