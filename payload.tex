\chapter{Trace Encoder Output Packet}

Used to output encoded instruction trace.  Four different formats are used according to the needs of the encoding algorithm.

        format	& 2	& 00 (full-delta): includes branch map and full address \newline
                        01 (diff-delta): includes branch map and differential address\\
        \hline
        branches & 5 & Number of valid bits in branch-map. The length of branch-map is determined as follows: \newline
        0-1: 	1 bit \newline
        2-9: 	9 bits \newline
        10-17: 	17 bits \newline
        18-25: 	25 bits \newline
        26-31: 	31 bits  \\
        \hline
        branch-map & See\footnote{Number of bits determined by branches field} & An array of bits indicating whether branches are taken or not.\newline
        Bit 0 represents the oldest branch instruction executed.   For each bit: \newline
        0: branch taken \newline
        1: branch not taken \\
        \hline
        address	& See\footnote {\label{iaddressbits}Number of bits is iaddress-width-p - iaddress-lsb-p} & Differential or full instruction address, according to format.  \newline
        When branches is 31 (indicating a full address map), the address is only valid if the instruction immediately prior to the final branch causes an unpredicatable discontinuity.\\
