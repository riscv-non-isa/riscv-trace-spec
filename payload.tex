\chapter{Trace Encoder Output Packets} \label{packets}

The bulk of this section describes the payload of packets output from the Trace Encoder.  
The infrastructure used to transport these packets is outside the scope of this document, and
as such the manner in which packets are encapsulated for transport is not specified.
However, the following information must be provided to the encapsulator:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The packet type;
  \item The packet length, in bytes;
  \item The packet payload.
\end{itemize}

Two example transport schemes are the UltraSoC Messaging Infrastructure, and the Arm Trace Bus.
Figure~\ref{fig:packet-format} shows the encapsulation used for the UltraSoC infrastructure:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The header byte contains a 5-bit field specifying the payload length in bytes, a 2-bit
    field indicating the "flow" (destination routing indicator), and a bit to indicate whether
    an optional 16-bit timestamp is present;
  \item The index field indicates the source of the packet.  The number of bits is system dependent,
    And the initial value emitted by the trace encoder is zero (it gets adjusted as it propagates 
    through the infrastructure);
  \item An optional 2-byte timestamp;
  \item The packet payload.
\end{itemize}

  \end{center}
\end{figure}


Alternatively, for ATB, the source of the packet is indicated by the \textbf{ATID} bus field, and there is
no equivalent of "flow", so an example encapsulation might be:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A 5-bit field specifying the payload length in bytes
  \item A bit to indicate whether an optional 16-bit timestamp is present;
  \item An optional 2-byte timestamp;
  \item The packet payload.
\end{itemize}
It may be desirable for packets to start aligned to an ATB word, in which the \textbf{ATBYTES} bus field
in the last beat of a packet can be used to indicate the number of valid bytes.

The remainder of this section describes the contents of the payload
portion which should be independent of the infrastructure.  In each table, the fields are listed in
transmission order: first field in the table is transmited first, and multi-bit fields are 
transmitted LSB first.

This packet payload format is used to output encoded instruction
trace.  Three different formats are used according to the needs of the
encoding algorithm. The following tables show the format of the
payload - i.e. excluding any encapsulation.

In order to achieve best performance, actual packet lengths may be adjusted using 'sign based compression'.
At the very minimum this should be applied to the address field of format 1 and 2 packets, but ideally will 
be applied to the whole packet, regardless of format.  This technique eliminates identical bits from the most 
significant end of the packet, and adjusts the length of the packet accordingly.  A decoder receiving this 
shortened packet can reconstruct the original full-length packet by sign-extending from the most significant
received bit.  An example of how this technique is used to choose between address formats is given in 
Section~\ref{addresses}.  The same principal can be applied to the entire packet, and the length (typically 
given in bytes) adjusted accordingly.

Where the payload length given in the following tables, or after applying sign-based compression, is not a 
multiple of whole bytes in length, the payload must be sign-extended to the nearest byte boundary.

Whilst offering maximum encoding efficiency, variable length packets can present some challenges,
specifically in terms of identifying where the boundaries between packets occur either when packed
packets are written to memory, or when packets are streamed offchip via a communications channel.  Two 
potential solutions to this are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If the maximum packet payload length is 2\textsuperscript{N}-1 (for example, if N is 5, then the maximum length is
    31 bytes), and the minimum packet payload length is 1, then a sequence of at least 2\textsuperscript{N} zero 
    bytes cannot occur within a packet payload, and therefore the first non-zero byte seen after a sequence of 
    at least 2\textsuperscript{N} zero bytes must be the first byte of a packet.  This approach can be used for
    alignment in either memory or a data stream;
  \item An alternative approach suitable for packets written to memory is to divide memory into blocks of M bytes
    (e.g. 1kbyte blocks), and write packets to memory such that the first byte in every block is always the first
    byte of a packet.  This means packets cannot span block boundaries, and so zero bytes must be used to pad between 
    the end of the last message in a block and the block boundary.
\end{itemize}
