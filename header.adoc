== Change History
[%autowidth,align="center",float="center",cols="<,<",options="header"]
|===
|2.0|Baseline
|15-Dec-2023 |Clarifications only - no changes to normative behaviour. +
- Control field definitions removed from section 2, which now references the xref:https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/e-trace-encap/releases/latest/[RISC-V Trace Control Interface Specification] +
- Added detail on handling of multi-load/store instructions for data trace to <<sec:DataInterfaceRequirements>>. +
- Removed references to tail-calls in jump classifications in <<sec:InstructionInterfaceRequirements>>. +
- Corrected typos where `lrid` was inadvertently refered to by an earlier name (`index`) in <<sec:data-loadstore>>. +
- Corrected reference decoder in <<Decoder>> to cover a corner-case related to trap returns.
|05-Mar-2024 |First version in AsciiDoc format.
|19-Apr-2024 |Formatting and typo fixes.
|This edition |
- Minor clarifications, formatting and typo fixes;  +
- Updated <<packets>> and <<fragments>> to reference the https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/e-trace-encap/releases/latest/[Unformatted Trace & Diagnostic Data Packet Encapsulation for RISC-V Specification]; +
- Removed ambiguity between 'last' and 'final'.  Last was previously used to mean both the instruction before the current one, and the final instruction traced; +
- Clarified behaviour when trace-on and trace-off triggers occur both occur in the same cycle (see <<sec:trigger>>); +
- Clarified that full synchronization also takes place on a privilege change (see <<sec:synchronization>> and <<sec:thaddr>>); +
- Reworded jump classifications in jump classifications in <<sec:InstructionInterfaceRequirements>> to align with terminology used in other specifications; +
- Clarified when to issue sync-support packet when trace is enabled (see <<sec:format33>>); +
- Updated reference encoding algorithm to generalize resync behaviour and add missing trap conditions (see <<Algorithm>>).
