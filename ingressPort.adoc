[[sec:InstructionInterfaceRequirements]]
=== Instruction Trace Interface requirements

This section describes in general terms the information which must be
passed from the RISC-V hart to the trace encoder for the purposes of
Instruction Trace, and distinguishes between what is mandatory, and what
is optional.

The following information is mandatory:

* The number of instructions that are being retired;
* Whether there has been an exception or interrupt, and if so the cause
(from the *_ucause/scause/vscause/mcause_* CSR) and trap value (from the
*_utval/stval/vstval/mtval_* CSR).
+
The register set to output should be the set that is updated as a result
of the exception (i.e. the set associated with the privilege level
immediately following the exception);
* The current privilege level of the RISC-V hart;
* The _instruction_type_ of retired instructions for:
** Jumps with a target that cannot be inferred from the source code;
** Taken and nontaken branches;
** Return from exception or interrupt (*_*ret_* instructions).
* The _instruction_address_ for:
** Jumps with a target that _cannot_ be inferred from the source code;
** The instruction retired immediately after a jump with a target that
_cannot_ be inferred from the source code (also referred to as the
target or destination of the jump);
** Taken and nontaken branches;
** The last instruction retired before an exception or interrupt;
** The first instruction retired following an exception or interrupt;
** The last instruction retired before a privilege change;
** The first instruction retired following a privilege change.

The following information is optional:

* Context or Time information:
** The context and/or hart ID and/or time;
** The type of action to take when context or time data changes.
* The _instruction_type_ of instructions for:
** Calls with a target that _cannot_ be inferred from the source code;
** Calls with a target that _can_ be inferred from the source code;
** Jumps with a target that _cannot_ be inferred from the source code;
** Jumps with a target that _can_ be inferred from the source code;
** Returns with a target that _cannot_ be inferred from the source code;
** Returns with a target that _can_ be inferred from the source code;
** Co-routine swap;
** Other jumps which don’t fit any of the above classifications with a
target that _cannot_ be inferred from the source code;
** Other jumps which don’t fit any of the above classifications with a
target that _can_ be inferred from the source code.
* If context or time is supported then the _instruction_address_ for:
** The last instruction retired before a context or a time change;
** The first instruction retired following a context or time change.
* Whether jump targets are sequentially inferable or not.

The mandatory information is the bare-minimum required to implement the
branch trace algorithm outlined in Chapter link:#Algorithm[[Algorithm]].
The optional information facilitates alternative or improved trace
algorithms:

* Implicit return mode (see
Section #sec:implicit-return[[sec:implicit-return]]) requires the
encoder to keep track of the number of nested function calls, and to do
this it must be aware of all calls and returns regardless of whether the
target can be inferred or not;
* A simpler algorithm useful for basic code profiling would only report
function calls and returns, again regardless of whether the target can
be inferred or not;
* Branch prediction techniques can be used to further improve the
encoder efficiency, particularly for loops (see
Section #sec:branch-prediction[[sec:branch-prediction]]). This requires
the encoder to be aware of the address of all branches, whether they are
taken or not.
* Uninferable jumps can be treated as inferable (which don’t need to be
reported in the trace output) if both the jump and the preceding
instruction which loads the target into a register have been traced.

[[Jump Classes]]
==== Jump classification and target inference

Jumps are classified as _inferable_, or _uninferable_. An _inferable_
jump has a target which can be deduced from the binary executable or
representation thereof (e.g. ELF). For the purposes of this
specification, the following strict definition applies:

If the target of a jump is supplied via a constant embedded within the
jump opcode, it is classified as _inferable_. Jumps which are not
_inferable_ are by definition _uninferable_.

However, there are some jump targets which can still be deduced from the
binary executable by considering pairs of instructions even though by
the above definition they are classified as uninferable. Specifically,
jump targets that are supplied via

* an *_lui_* or *_c.lui_* (a register which contains a constant), or
* an *_auipc_* (a register which contains a constant offset from the
PC).

Such jump targets are classified as _sequentially inferable_ if the pair
of instructions are retired consecutively (i.e. the *_auipc_*, *_lui_*
or *_c.lui_* immediately precedes the jump). Note: the restriction that
the instructions are retired consecutively is necessary in order to
minimize the additional signalling needed between the hart and the
encoder, and should have a minimal impact on trace efficiency as it is
anticipated that consecutive execution will be the norm. Support for
sequentially inferable jumps is optional.

Jumps may optionally be further classified according to the recommended
calling convention:

* _Calls_:
** *_jal_* x1;
** *_jal_* x5;
** *_jalr_* x1, rs where rs != x5;
** *_jalr_* x5, rs where rs != x1;
** *_c.jalr_* rs1 where rs1 != x5;
** *_c.jal_*.
* _Jumps_:
** *_jal_* x0;
** *_c.j_*;
** *_jalr_* x0, rs where rs != x1 and rs != x5;
** *_c.jr_* rs1 where rs1 != x1 and rs1 != x5.
* _Returns_:
** *_jalr_* rd, rs where (rs == x1 or rs == x5) and rd != x1 and rd !=
x5;
** *_c.jr_* rs1 where rs1 == x1 or rs1 == x5.
* _Co-routine swap_:
** *_jalr_* x1, x5;
** *_jalr_* x5, x1;
** *_c.jalr_* x5.
* _Other_:
** *_jal_* rd where rd != x0 and rd != x1 and rd != x5;
** *_jalr_* rd, rs where rs != x1 and rs != x5 and rd != x0 and rd != x1
and rd != x5.

[[sec:relationship]]
==== Relationship between RISC-V core and the encoder

The encoder is intended to encode the instructions executed on a single
hart.

It is however commonplace for a RISC-V core to contain multiple harts.
This can be supported by the core in several different ways:

* Implement a separate instance of the interface per hart. Each instance
can be connected to a separate encoder instance, allowing all harts to
be traced concurrently. Alternatively, external muxing may be used in
conjunction with a single encoder in order to trace one particular hart
at a time;
* Implement a singe interface for the core, with muxing inside the core
to select which hart to connect to the interface.

(Whilst it is technically feasible to use a single encoder with multiple
harts operating in a fine-grained multi-threaded configuration, the
frequent context changes that would occur as a result of
thread-switching would result in extremely poor encoding efficiency, and
so this configuration is not recommended.)

[[sec:InstructionTraceInterface]]
=== Instruction Trace Interface

This section describes the interface between a RISC-V hart and the trace
encoder that conveys the information described in the section
 #sec:InstructionInterfaceRequirements[1.1]. Signals are assigned to one
of the following groups:

* M: Mandatory. The interface must include an instance of this signal.
* O: Optional. The interface may include an instance of this signal.
* MR: Mandatory, may be replicated. For harts that can retire a maximum
of N "special" instructions per clock cycle, the interface must include
N instances of this signal.
* OR: Optional, may be replicated. For harts that can retire a maximum
of N "special" per clock cycle, the interface must include zero or N
instances of this signal.
* BR: Block, may be replicated. Mandatory for harts that can retire
multiple instructions in a block. Replication as per OR. If omitted, the
interface must include SR group signals instead.
* SR: Single, may be replicated. Mandatory for harts that can only
retire one instruction in a block. Replication as per OR (see
section #sec:alt-multi[1.2.2]). If omitted, the interface must include
BR group signals instead.

"Special" instructions are those that require *itype* to be non-zero.

Tables #tab:common-ingress[[tab:common-ingress]] and
 #tab:multi-ingress[[tab:multi-ingress]] list the signals in the
interface designed to efficiently support retirement of multiple
instructions per cycle. The following discussion describes the
multiple-retirement behavior. However, for harts that can only retire
one instruction at a time, the signalling can be simplified, and this is
discussed subsequently in Section #sec:single-retire[1.2.1].

The information presented in a block represents a contiguous block of
instructions starting at *iaddr*, all of which retired in the same
cycle. Note if *itype* is 1 or 2 (indicating an exception or an
interrupt), the number of instructions retired may be zero. *cause* and
*tval* are only defined if *itype* is 1 or 2. If **iretire**=0 and
**itype**=0, the values of all other signals are undefined.

*iretire* contains the number of (16-bit) half-words represented by
instructions retired in this block, and *ilastsize* the size of the last
instruction. Half-words rather than instruction count enables the
encoder to easily compute the address of the last instruction in the
block without having access to the size of every instruction in the
block.

*itype* can be 3 or 4 bits wide. If _itype_width_p_ is 3, a single code
(6) is used to indicate all uninferable jumps. This is simpler to
implement, but precludes use of the implicit return mode (see
section #sec:implicit-return[[sec:implicit-return]]), which requires
jump types to be fully classified.

Whilst *iaddr* is typically a virtual address, it does not affect the
encoder’s behavior if it is a physical address.

For harts that can retire a maximum of N non-zero *itype* values per
clock cycle, the signal groups MR, OR and either BR or SR must be
replicated N times. Typically N is determined by the maximum number of
branches that can be retired per clock cycle. Signal group 0 represents
information about the oldest instruction block, and group N-1 represents
the newest instruction block. The interface supports no more than one
privilege change, context change, exception or interrupt per cycle and
so signals in groups M and O are not replicated. Furthermore, *itype*
can only take the value 1 or 2 in one of the signal groups, and this
must be the newest valid group (i.e. *iretire* and *itype* must be zero
for higher numbered groups). If fewer than N groups are required in a
cycle, then lower numbered groups must be used first. For example, if
there is one branch, use only group 0, if there are two branches,
instructions up to the 1st branch must be reported in group 0 and
instructions up to the 2nd branch must be reported in group 1 and so on.

*sijump* is optional and may be omitted if the hart does not implement
the logic to detect sequentially inferable jumps. If the encoder offers
an *sijump* input it must also provide a parameter to indicate whether
the input is connected to a hart that implements this capability, or
tied off. This is to ensure the decoder can be made aware of the hart’s
capability. Enabling sequentially inferable jump mode in the encoder and
decoder when the hart does not support it will prevent correct
reconstruction by the decoder.

The *context* and/or the *time* field can be used to convey any
additional information to the decoder. For example:

* The address space and virtual machine IDs (*ASID* and *VMID*
respectively). Where present it is recommended these values be wired to
bits [15:0] and [29:16];
* The software thread ID;
* The process ID from an operating system;
* It could be used to convey the values of CSRs to the decoder by
setting *context* to the CSR number and value when a CSR is written;
* In cases where a single encoder is being shared amongst multiple harts
(see section #sec:relationship[1.1.2]), it could also be used to
indicate the hart ID, in cases where the hart ID can be changed
dynamically.
* Time from within the hart

Table #tab:context-type[[tab:context-type]] specifies the actions for
the various *ctype* values. A typical behavior would be for this signal
to remain zero except on the 1st retirement after a context change or
when a time value should be reported. _ctype_width_p_ may be 1 or 2. The
reduced width option only provides support for reporting context changes
imprecisely.

|l|l|p90mm| *Type* & *Value* & *Actions* +
Unreported & 0 & No action (don’t report context). +
Report context imprecisely & 1 & An example would be a SW thread or
operating system process change. Report the new context value at the
earliest convenient opportunity. It is reported without any address
information, and the assumption is that the precise point of context
change can be deduced from the source code (e.g. a CSR write). +
Report context precisely & 2 & Report the address of the 1st instruction
retired in this block, and the new context. If there were unreported
branches beforehand, these need to be reported first. Treated the same
as a privilege change. +

asynchronous discontinuity & & Need to report the last instruction
retired on the previous context, as well as the 1st on the new context.
Treated the same as an exception. +

[[sec:single-retire]]
==== Simplifications for single-retirement

For harts that can only retire one instruction at a time, the interface
can be simplified to the signals listed in
tables #tab:common-ingress[[tab:common-ingress]] and
 #tab:single-ingress[[tab:single-ingress]]. The simplifications can be
summarized as follows:

* *iretire* simply indicates whether an instruction retired or not;

*Note:* *ilastsize* is still needed in order to determine the address of
the next instruction, as this is the predicted return address for
implicit return mode (see
Section #sec:implicit-return[[sec:implicit-return]]).

The parameter _retires_p_ which indicates to the encoder the maximum
number of instructions that can be retired per cycle can be used by an
encoder capable of supporting single or multiple retirement to select
the appropriate interpretation of *iretire*.

[[sec:alt-multi]]
==== Alternative multiple-retirement interface configurations

For a hart that can retire multiple instructions per cycle, but no more
than one branch, the preferred solution is to use one instance of
signals from groups BR, MR and OR. However, if the hart can retire N
branches in a cycle, N instances of signals from groups MR, OR and
either SR or BR must be used (each instance can be either a single
instruction or a block).

If the hart can retire N instructions per cycle, but only one branch, it
is allowed (though not recommended) to provide explicit details of every
instruction retired by using N instances of signals from groups SR, MR
and OR.

==== Optional sideband signals

Optional sideband signals may be included to provide additional
functionality, as described in tables
#tab:ingress-side-band[[tab:ingress-side-band]] and
#tab:egress-side-band[[tab:egress-side-band]].

Note, any user defined information that needs to be output by the
encoder will need to be applied via the *context* input.

|l|p18mm|p85mm| *Signal* & *Group* & *Function* +
*impdef*[_impdef_width_p_-1:0] & O & Implementation defined sideband
signals. A typical use for these would be for filtering (see
Chapter #ch:filtering[[ch:filtering]]. +
*trigger*[2+:0] & [1:0]: O : OR & A pulse on bit 0 will cause the
encoder to start tracing, and continue until further notice, subject to
other filtering criteria also being met. A pulse on bit 1 will cause the
encoder to stop tracing until further notice. See
section #sec:trigger[1.2.4]). +
*halted* & O & Hart is halted. Upon assertion, the encoder will output a
packet to report the address of the last instruction retired before
halting, followed by a support packet to indicate that tracing has
stopped. Upon deassertion, the encoder will start tracing again,
commencing with a synchronization packet. *Note:* If this signal is not
provided, it is strongly recommended that Debug mode can be signalled
via a 3-bit *privilege* signal. This will allow tracing in Debug mode to
be controlled via the optional filtering capabilities. +
*reset* & O & Hart is in reset. Provided the encoder is in a different
reset domain to the hart, this allows the encoder to indicate that
tracing has ended on entry to reset, and restarted on exit. Behavior is
as described above for halt. +

|l|l|p125mm| *Signal* & *Group* & *Function* +
*stall* & O & Stall request to hart. Some applications may require
lossless trace, which can be achieved by using this signal to stall the
hart if the trace encoder is unable to output a trace packet (for
example due to back-pressure from the packet transport
infrastructure). +

[[sec:trigger]]
==== Using trigger outputs from the Debug Module

The debug module of the RISC-V hart may have a trigger unit. This
defines a match control register (*_mcontrol_*) containing a 4-bit
*action* field, and reserves codes 2 - 5 of this field for trace use.
These action codes are hereby defined as shown in table
#tab:debugModuleTriggerSupport[[tab:debugModuleTriggerSupport]]. If
implemented, each action must generate a pulse on an output from the
hart, on the same cycle as the instruction which caused the trigger is
retired.

|l|p140mm| *Value* & *Description* +
& _Trace-on_. This should be connected to *trigger[0]* if the encoder
provides it. +
& _Trace-off_. This should be connected to *trigger[1]* if the encoder
provides it. +
& _Trace-notify_. This should be connected to **trigger[1 +
_blocks_:**2] if the encoder provides it. This will cause the encoder to
output a packet containing the address of the last instruction in the
block if it is enabled. One bit per block. +

Trace-on and Trace-off actions provide a means for the hart to control
when tracing starts and stops. It is recommended that tracing starts
from the oldest instruction retired in the cycle that Trace-on is
asserted, and stops following the newest instruction retired in the
cycle that Trace-off is asserted (subject to any optional filtering).

Trace-notify provides means to ensure that a specified instruction is
explicitly reported (subject to any optional filtering). This capability
is sometimes known as a watchpoint.

[[sec:DataInterfaceRequirements]]
=== Data Trace Interface requirements

This section describes in general terms the information which must be
passed from the RISC-V hart to the trace encoder for the purposes of
Data Trace, and distinguishes between what is mandatory, and what is
optional.

If Data Trace is not needed in a system then there is no requirement for
the RISC-V hart to supply any of the signals in section
 #sec:DataTraceInterface[1.4].

Data trace supports up to four data access types: load, store, atomic
and CSR. Support for both atomic and CSR accesses are independently
optional.

The signalling protocol can take one of two forms, depending on the
needs of the RISC-V hart: _unified_ or _split_.

Unified is the simplest form, suitable for simpler, in-order harts. In
this form, all information about a data access is signalled by the
RISC-V hart in the same cycle that the associated data access
instruction is reported on the instruction trace interface.

For harts with out of order or speculative execution capabilities, many
loads may be in progress simultaneously, and this approach is not
practical as it would require the hart to maintain a large amount of
state relating to all the in-progress loads. For this reason, the
interface also supports splitting loads into two parts:

* The _request_ phase provides all the information about the load that
originates from the hart (address, size, etc.) when the instruction
retires;
* The _response_ phase provides the data and response status when it has
been returned to the hart from the memory system.

The two parts of a split load are associated by use of a transaction ID.

The Zc (code-size reduction) extension introduced push and pop
instructions (_cm.push_, _cm.pop_, _cm.popret_ and _cm.popretz_) that
each result in multiple loads or stores. To allow the resulting loads or
stores to be associated with the correct instruction, these
multi-memory-access instructions (and any other future instructions with
similar characteristics) must be reported on the instruction trace
interface multiple times (once for each individual load or store) using
*itype* 0 except for the final load or store, which must retire using
the natural *itype* for the instruction (for example, a _cm.popret_
instruction must use *itype* 13 for the final load to signal the
return). The instruction address reported will be the same for each
occurrence.

The following illustrations show the retirement sequences when a single
_cm.push_ or _cm.popret_ is used to push or pop 4 registers from the
stack. They assume a RISC-V to encoder interface that can report a block
of 1 or more retired instructions and one load or store per cycle. Each
comprises 4 elements, and shows the instruction information reported for
each load and store. As detailed in section
#sec:InstructionTraceInterface[1.2], this takes the form of the address
of an instruction, the length of the block (1 for a single instruction)
and the type of the final instruction in the block. In each element,
’Block’ indicates a block of 1 or more instructions (i.e. could also be
a single instruction), whereas ’Single’ indicates a single instruction
(i.e. a block with a length of 1).

A _cm.push_ is equivalent to 4 store instructions:

. Block - last instruction is _cm.push_, *itype* 0 (data trace interface
reports 1st store);
. Single - _cm.push_, *itype* 0 (data trace interface reports 2nd
store);
. Single - _cm.push_, *itype* 0 (data trace interface reports 3rd
store);
. Block - 1st instruction is _cm.push_, *itype* dependent on last
instruction in block (data trace interface reports 4th store);

A _cm.popret_ is equivalent to 4 loads and a return:

. Block - last instruction is _cm.popret_, *itype* 0 (data trace
interface reports 1st load);
. Single - _cm.popret_, *itype* 0 (data trace interface reports 2nd
load);
. Single - _cm.popret_, *itype* 0 (data trace interface reports 3rd
load);
. Single - _cm.popret_, *itype* 13 (data trace interface reports 4th
load);

If an exception occurs part way through the sequence of loads or stores
initiated by such an instruction, and the instruction is re-executed
after the exception handler has been serviced, the load or store
sequence must recommence from the beginning.

*Note:* This is required for data trace only. If data trace is not
implemented, the push or pop may instead be reported just once in the
normal way when all associated loads or stores complete successfully.

For harts that can retire a maximum of M data accesses per cycle, the
implemented signal groups must be replicated M times. If fewer than M
groups are required in a cycle, then lower numbered groups must be used
first. For example, if there is one data access, use only group 0.

The maximum value of _dtype_width_p_ is 4. However, if only loads and
stores are supported, _dtype_width_p_ can be 1. If CSRs are supported
but atomics are not, _dtype_width_p_ can be 3.

Atomic and CSR accesses have either both load and store data, or store
data and an operand. For CSRs and unified atomics, both values are
reported via *data*, with the store data in the LSBs and the load data
or operand in the MSBs.

_lrid_width_p_ is determined by the maximum number of loads that can be
in progress simultaneously, such that at any one time there can be no
more than one load in progress with a given ID.

*iaddr_lsbs* and *dblock* are provided to support filtering of which
data accesses to trace based on their instruction address. This is best
illustrated by considering the following instruction sequence:

. load
. {blank}
. load
. {blank}
. {blank}

Suppose the hart is capable of retiring up to 4 instructions in a cycle,
via a single block. Instruction trace is enabled throughout, but the
requirement is to collect data trace for the 1st load (instruction 1),
and filtering is configured to match the address of this instruction
only. However, information about instruction addresses is passed to the
encoder at the block level, and the block boundaries are invisible to
the decoder. For instruction trace, all instructions in a block are
traced if any of the instructions in that block match the filtering
criteria. That is fine for instruction trace - the address of the 1st
and last traced instruction are output explicitly. There will be some
fuzziness about precisely what those addresses will be depending on
where the block boundaries fall, but this is not a concern as everything
is always self-consistent.

However, that is not the case for data trace. Consider two scenarios:

* Case 1: 1st block contains instructions 1, 2, 3; second block contains
4, 5
* Case 2: 1st block contains instructions 1, 2; second block contains 3,
4, 5

Given that *iretire* is non-zero in the same cycle that the data access
retires, the encoder knows the address of the 1st and last instructions
in a block, but does not know precisely where in the block the data
access is. In both cases, the first block matches the filtering criteria
(it contains the address of instruction 1), and the second block does
not. But if the encoder traced all the data accesses in the matching
block, then in case 1 it would trace both instructions 1 and 3, whereas
in the second case it would trace only instruction 1. The decoder has no
visibility of the block boundaries so cannot account for this. It is
expecting only instruction 1 to be traced, and so may misinterpret
instruction 3. If this code is in a loop for example, it will assume
that the 2nd traced load is in fact instruction 1 from the next loop
iteration, rather than instruction 3 from this iteration.

Providing the LSBs of the data access instruction address allows the
decoder to determine precisely whether the data access should be traced
or not, and removes the dependency on the block sizes and boundaries.
The number of bits required is one more bit than the number required to
index within the block because blocks can start on any half-word
boundary.

For harts that replicate the block signals to allow multiple blocks to
retire per cycle it is also necessary to indicate which block each data
access is associated with, so the encoder knows which block address to
combine with the LSBs in order to construct the actual data access
instruction address. 1 bit for 2 blocks per cycle, 2 bits for 4, and so
on.
