== Instruction Trace Encoder Output Packets

The bulk of this section describes the payload of packets output from
the Instruction Trace Encoder. The infrastructure used to transport
these packets is outside the scope of this document, and as such the
manner in which packets are encapsulated for transport is not specified.
However, the following information must be provided to the encapsulator:

* The packet type;
* The packet length, in bytes;
* The packet payload.

Two example transport schemes are the Siemens Messaging Infrastructure,
and the Arm Trace Bus. <<fig:packet-format>> shows the
encapsulation used for the Siemens infrastructure:

* The header byte contains a 5-bit field specifying the payload length
in bytes, a 2-bit field indicating the "flow" (destination routing
indicator), and a bit to indicate whether an optional 16-bit timestamp
is present;
* The index field indicates the source of the packet. The number of bits
is system dependent, And the initial value emitted by the trace encoder
is zero (it gets adjusted as it propagates through the infrastructure);
* An optional 2-byte timestamp;
* The packet payload.

[[fig:packet-format]]
.Example encapsulated packet format

Alternatively, for ATB, the source of the packet is indicated by the
*ATID* bus field, and there is no equivalent of "flow", so an example
encapsulation might be:

* A 5-bit field specifying the payload length in bytes
* A bit to indicate whether an optional 16-bit timestamp is present;
* An optional 2-byte timestamp;
* The packet payload.

It may be desirable for packets to start aligned to an ATB word, in
which the *ATBYTES* bus field in the last beat of a packet can be used
to indicate the number of valid bytes.

The remainder of this section describes the contents of the payload
portion which should be independent of the infrastructure. In each
table, the fields are listed in transmission order: first field in the
table is transmitted first, and multi-bit fields are transmitted LSB
first.

This packet payload format is used to output encoded instruction trace.
Three different formats are used according to the needs of the encoding
algorithm. The following tables show the format of the payload - i.e.
excluding any encapsulation.

In order to achieve best performance, actual packet lengths may be
adjusted using 'sign based compression'. At the very minimum this should
be applied to the address field of format 1 and 2 packets, but ideally
will be applied to the whole packet, regardless of format. This
technique eliminates identical bits from the most significant end of the
packet, and adjusts the length of the packet accordingly. A decoder
receiving this shortened packet can reconstruct the original full-length
packet by sign-extending from the most significant received bit.

Where the payload length given in the following tables, or after
applying sign-based compression, is not a multiple of whole bytes in
length, the payload must be sign-extended to the nearest byte boundary.

Whilst offering maximum encoding efficiency, variable length packets can
present some challenges, specifically in terms of identifying where the
boundaries between packets occur either when packed packets are written
to memory, or when packets are streamed offchip via a communications
channel. Two potential solutions to this are as follows:

* If the maximum packet payload length is 2^N^-1 (for example, if N is
5, then the maximum length is 31 bytes), and the minimum packet payload
length is 1, then a sequence of at least 2^N^ zero bytes cannot occur
within a packet payload, and therefore the first non-zero byte seen
after a sequence of at least 2^N^ zero bytes must be the first byte of a
packet. This approach can be used for alignment in either memory or a
data stream;
* An alternative approach suitable for packets written to memory is to
divide memory into blocks of M bytes (e.g. 1kbyte blocks), and write
packets to memory such that the first byte in every block is always the
first byte of a packet. This means packets cannot span block boundaries,
and so zero bytes must be used to pad between the end of the last
message in a block and the block boundary.

=== Format 3 packets

Format 3 packets are used for synchronization, traps, reporting context
and supporting information. There are 4 sub-formats.

Throughout this document, the term "synchronization packet" is used.
This refers specifically to format 3, subformat 0 and subformat 1
packets.

[[sec:format30]]
=== Format 3 subformat 0 - Synchronisation

This packet contains all the information the decoder needs to fully
identify an instruction. It is sent for the first traced instruction
(unless that instruction also happens to be the first in a trap
handler), and when resynchronization has been scheduled by expiry of the
resynchronisation timer.

|===
| *Field name*| *Bits*| *Description*
|*format*| 2| 11 (sync): synchronisation
|*subformat*| 2| 00 (start): Start of tracing, or resync
|*branch*| 1| Set to 0 if the address points to a branch instruction,
and the branch was taken. Set to 1 if the instruction is not a branch or
if the branch is not taken.
|*privilege*| _privilege_width_p_| The privilege level of the reported
instruction
|*time*| _time_width_p_ or 0 if _notime_p_ is 1| The time value.
|*context*| _context_width_p_, or 0 if _nocontext_p_ is 1| The
instruction context.
|*address*| _iaddress_width_p - iaddress_lsb_p_| Full instruction
address. Address alignment is determined by _iaddress_lsb_p_ Address
must be left shifted in order to recreate original byte address.
|===

==== Format 3 *branch* field

This bit indicates the taken/not taken status in the case where the
reported address points to a branch instruction. Overall efficiency
would be slightly improved if this bit was removed, and the branch
status was instead "carried over" and reported in the next _te_inst_
packet. This was considered, but there are several pathological cases
where this approach fails. Consider for example the situation where the
first traced instruction is a branch, and this is then followed
immediately by an exception. This results in format 3 packets being
generated on two consecutive instructions. The second packet does not
contain a branch map, so there is no way to report the branch status of
the 1st branch, apart from by inserting a format 1 packet in between.
There are two issues with this:

* It would require the generation of 2 packets on the same cycle, which
adds significant additional complexity to the encoder;
* It would complicate the algorithm shown in
<<fig:algo>>.

[[sec:format31]]
=== Format 3 subformat 1 - Trap

This packet also contains all the information the decoder needs to fully
identify an instruction. It is sent following an exception or interrupt,
and includes the cause, the 'trap value' (for exceptions), and the
address of the trap handler, or of the exception itself - <<sec:thaddr>>.

If the implicit exception mode is enabled (see
<<sec:implicit-exception>>), the trap
handler address is omitted if *thaddr* is 1.

|*format*| 2| 11 (sync): synchronisation
|*subformat*| 2| 01 (trap): Exception or interrupt cause and trap
handler address.
|*branch*| 1| Set to 0 if the address points to a branch instruction,
and the branch was taken. Set to 1 if the instruction is not a branch or
if the branch is not taken.
|*privilege*| _privilege_width_p_| The privilege level of the reported
instruction.
|*time*| _time_width_p_ or 0 if _notime_p_ is 1| The time value.

address. When set to 0, *address* points to the EPC for an exception at
the target of an updiscon, and is undefined for other exceptions and
interrupts.
|*address*| _iaddress_width_p - iaddress_lsb_p_| Full instruction
address. Address alignment is determined by _iaddress_lsb_p_ Address
must be left shifted in order to recreate original byte address.
|*tval*| _iaddress_width_p_| Value from appropriate
*utval/stval/vstval/mtval* CSR. Field omitted for interrupts
|===

[[sec:thaddr]]
==== Format 3 *thaddr* and *address* fields

If an exception occurs at the target of an uninferable PC discontinuity,
the value of the EPC cannot be infered from the program binary, and so
*address* contains the EPC and *thaddr* is set to 0. In this case, the
trap handler address will be reported via a subsequent format 3,
subformat 0 packet.

Usually when an exception or interrupt occurs, the cause is reported
along with the 1st address of the trap handler, when that instruction
retires. In this case, *thaddr* is 1. However, if a second interrupt or
exception occurs immediately, details of this must still be reported,
even though the 1st instruction of the handler hasn't retired. In this
situation, *thaddr* is 0, and *address* is undefined (unless it contains
the EPC as outlined in the previous paragraph).

(The reason for not reporting the EPC for all exceptions when *thaddr*
is 0 is that it may be at either the address of the next instruction or
current instruction depending on the exception cause, which can be
inferred by the decoder without adding complexity to the encoder.)

==== Format 3 *tval* field

This field reports the "trap value" from the appropriate
*utval/stval/vstval/mtval* CSR, the meaning of which is dependent on the
nature of the exception. It is omitted from the packet for interrupts.

[[sec:format32]]
=== Format 3 subformat 2 - Context

This packet contains only the context and/or the timestamp, and is
output when the context value changes and can be reported imprecisely
(see <<tab:context-type>>).

|*context*| _context_width_p_, or 0 if _nocontext_p_ is 1| The
instruction context.
|===

[[sec:format33]]
=== Format 3 subformat 3 - Support

This packet provides supporting information to aid the decoder.  It must be issued:

* When trace is enabled, and before the first sync packet, in order to ensure the decoder is aware of how the encoder is configured.  This could be as late as when *trTeInstTracing* becomes 1, but it is recommended this be sent as soon as *trTeEnable* changes from 0 to 1. This reduces the likelihood of having to generate two packets (support and sync-start) at the point tracing actually starts;
* When tracing ceases for any reason (*trTeEnable* or *trTeInstTracing* set to 0, trace-off trigger, halt, reset, loss of filter qualification, etc.), in order to inform the decoder that the preceding packet reported the address of the final traced instruction;
* If one or more trace packets cannot be sent (for example, due back-pressure from the packet transport infrastructure);
* If the operating mode of the encoder changes such that the the information output in a previous support packet no longer applies (i.e. if *encoder_mode*, *ioptions*, *doptions* or *denable* change).

The *ioptions* and *doptions* fields are placeholders that must be replaced by an
implementation specific set of individual bits - one for each of the
optional modes supported by the encoder.

[[sec:qual-status]]
==== Format 3 subformat 3 *qual_status* field

When tracing ends, the encoder reports the address of the last traced
instruction, and follows this with a format 3, subformat 3 (supporting
information) packet. Two codes are provided for indicating that tracing
has ended: *ended_rep* and *ended_ntr*. This relates to exactly the same
ambiguous case described in detail in <<sec:updiscon>>, and
in principle, the mechanism described in that section can be used to
disambiguate when the last traced instruction is at looplabel. However,
that mechanism relies on knowing when creating the format 1/2 packet,
that a format 3 packet will be generated from the next instruction. This
is possible because the encoding algorithm uses a 3-stage pipe with
access to the previous, current and next instructions. However, decoding
that the next instruction is a privilege change or exception is
straightforward, but determining whether the next instruction meets the
filtering criteria is much more involved, and this information won't
typically be available, at least not without adding an additional
pipeline stage, which is expensive. This means a different mechanism is
required, and that is provided by having two codes to indicate that
tracing has ended:

* *ended_rep* indicates that the preceding packet would not have been
issued if tracing hadn't ended, which means that tracing stopped after
executing looplabel in the 1st loop iteration;
* *ended_ntr* indicates that the preceding packet would have been issued
anyway because of an uninferable PC discontinuity, which means that
tracing stopped after executing looplabel in the 2nd loop iteration;

If the encoder implementation does have early access to the filtering
results, and the designer chooses to use the *updiscon* bit when the
last qualified instruction is also the instruction following an
uninferable PC discontinuity, loss of qualification should always be
indicated using *ended_rep*.

[[sec:format2]]
=== Format 2 packets

This packet contains only an instruction address, and is used when the
address of an instruction must be reported, and there is no unreported
branch information. The address is in differential format unless full
address mode is enabled (see <<sec:full-address>>).

.Packet format 2
[%autowidth,align="center",float="center",cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| *Field name*| *Bits*| *Description*
|*format*| 2| 10 (addr-only): differential address and no branch
information
|*address*| _iaddress_width_p - iaddress_lsb_p_| Differential
instruction address.
|*notify*| 1| If the value of this bit is different from the MSB of
*address*, it indicates that this packet is reporting an instruction
that is not the target of an uninferable discontinuity because a
notification was requested via *trigger[2]* (see <<sec:trigger>>).
|*updiscon*| 1| If the value of this bit is different from *notify*, it
indicates that this packet is reporting the instruction following an
uninferable discontinuity and is also the instruction before an
exception, privilege change or resync (i.e. it will be followed
immediately by a format 3 _te_inst_).
|*irreport*| 1| If the value of this bit is different from *updiscon*,
it indicates that this packet is reporting an instruction that is
either: following a return because its address differs from the
predicted return address at the top of the implicit_return return
address stack, or the last retired before an exception, interrupt,
privilege change or resync because it is necessary to report the current
address stack depth or nested call count.
|*irdepth*| _return_stack_size_p + (return_stack_size_p > 0 ? 1 : 0)
 + call_counter_size_p_| If the value of *irreport* is different from
*updiscon*, this field indicates the number of entries on the return
address stack (i.e. the entry number of the return that failed) or
nested call count. If *irreport* is the same value as *updiscon*, all
bits in this field will also be the same value as *updiscon*.
|===

[[sec:notify]]
==== Format 2 *notify* field

This bit is encoded so that most of the time it will take the same value
as the MSB of the *address* field, and will therefore compress away,
having no impact on the encoding efficiency. It is required in order to
cover the case where an address is reported as a result of a
notification request, signalled by setting the *trigger[2]* input to 1.

[[sec:updiscon]]
==== Format 2 *notify* and *updiscon* fields

These bits are encoded so that most of the time they will compress away,
having no impact on efficiency, by taking on the same value as the
preceding bit in the packet (*notify* is normally the same value as the
MSB of the *address* field, and *updiscon* is normally the same value as
*notify*). They are required in order to cover a pathological case where
otherwise the decoding software would not be able to reconstruct the
program execution unambiguously. Consider the following code fragment:

 looplabel -4: *_opcode A_* 
 looplabel   : *_opcode B_* 
 looplabel +4: *_opcode C_*
 :
 looplabel +N *_JALR_* # Jump to looplabel

This is a loop with an indirect jump back to the next iteration. This is
an uninferable discontinuity, and will be reported via a format 1 or 2
packet. Note however that the initial entry into the loop is
fall-through from the instruction at looplabel - 4, and will not be
reported explicitly. This means that when reconstructing the execution
path of the program, the looplabel address is encountered twice. On
first glance, it appears that the decoder can determine when it reaches
the loop label for the 1st time that this is not the end of execution,
because the preceding instruction was not one that can cause an
uninferable discontinuity. It can therefore continue reconstructing the
execution path until it reaches the *_JALR_*, from where it can deduce
that *_opcode B_* at looplabel is the final retired instruction.
However, there are circumstances where this approach does not work. For
example, consider the case where there is an exception at looplabel + 4.
In this case, the decoder cannot tell whether this occurred during the
1st or 2nd loop iterations, without additional information from the
encoder. This is the purpose of the *updiscon* field. In more detail:

There are four scenarios to consider:

. Code executes through to the end of the 1st loop iteration, and the
encoder reports looplabel using format 1/2 following the *_JALR_*, then
carries on executing the 2nd pass of the loop. In this case *updiscon*
== *notify*. The next packet will be a format 1/2;
. Code executes through to the end of the 1st loop iteration and jumps
back to looplabel, but there is then an exception, privilege change or
resync in the second iteration at looplabel + 4. In this case, the
encoder reports looplabel using format 1/2 following the *_JALR_*, with
*updiscon* == !*notify*, and the next packet is a format 3;
. An exception occurs immediately after the 1st execution of looplabel.
In this case, the encoder reports looplabel using format 0/1/2 with
*updiscon* == *notify*, and the next packet is a format 3;
. The hart requests the encoder to notify retirement of the instruction
at looplabel. In this case, the encoder reports the 1st execution of
looplabel with *notify* == !*address[MSB]*, and subsequent executions
with *notify* == *address[MSB]* (because they would have been reported
anyway as a result of the *_JALR_*).

Looking at this from the perspective of the decoder, the decoder
receives a format 1/2 reporting the address of the 1st instruction in
the loop (looplabel). It follows the execution path from the last
reported address, until it reaches looplabel. Because looplabel is not
preceded by an uninferable discontinuity, it must take the value of
*notify* and *updiscon* into consideration, and may need to wait for the
next packet in order to determine whether it has reached the final
retired instruction:

* If *updiscon* == !*notify*, this indicates case 2. The decoder must
continue until it encounters looplabel a 2nd time;
* If *updiscon* == *notify*, the decoder cannot yet distinguish cases 1
and 3, and must wait for the next packet.
** If the next packet is a format 3, this is case 3. The decoder has
already reached the correct instruction;
** If the next packet is a format 1/2, this is case 1. The decoder must
continue until it encounters looplabel a 2nd time.
* If *notify* == !*address[MSB]*, this indicates case 4, 1st iteration.
The decoder has reached the correct instruction.

This example uses an exception at looplabel + 4, but anything that could
cause a format 3 for looplabel + 4 would result in the same behavior: a
privilege change, or the expiry of the resync timer. It could also occur
if looplabel was the last traced instruction (because tracing was
disabled for some reason). See <<sec:qual-status>> for
further discussion of this point.

[NOTE]
====
Correct decoder behavior could have been achieved by
implementing the *notify* bit only, setting it to the inverse of
*address[MSB]* whenever an address is reported and it is not the
instruction following an uninferable discontinuity. However, this would
have been much less efficient, as this would have required *notify* to
be different from *address[MSB]* the majority of the time when
outputting a format 1/2 before an exception, interrupt or resync (as the
probability of this instruction being the target of an uninferable jump
is low). Using 2 separate bits results in superior compression.
====

[[sec:irxx]]
==== Format 2 *irreport* and *irdepth*

These bits are encoded so that most of the time they will take the same
value as the *updiscon* field, and will therefore compress away, having
no impact on the encoding efficiency. If implicit_return mode is
enabled, the encoder keeps track of the number of traced nested calls,
either as a simple count (_call_counter_size_p_ non-zero) or a stack of
predicted return addresses (_return_stack_size_p_ non-zero).

Where a stack of predicted return addresses is implemented, the
predicted return addresses are compared with the actual return
addresses, and a _te_inst_ packet will be generated with *irreport* set
to the opposite value to *updiscon* if a misprediction occurs.

In some cases it is also necessary to report the current stack depth or
call count if the packet is reporting the last instruction before an
exception, interrupt, privilege change or resync. There are two cases of
concern:

* If the reported address is the instruction following a return, and it
is not mis-predicted, the encoder must report the current stack depth or
call count if it is non-zero. Without this, the decoder would attempt to
follow the execution path until it encountered the reported address from
the outermost nested call;
* If the reported address is not the instruction following a return, the
encoder must report the current stack depth or call count unless:
** There have been no returns since the last call (in which case the
decoder will correctly stop in the innermost call), or
** There has been at least one branch since the last return (in which
case the decoder will correctly stop in the call where there are no
unprocessed branches).
+
Without this, the decoder would follow the execution path until it
encountered the reported address, and in most cases this would be the
correct point. However, this cannot be guaranteed for recursive
functions, as the reported address will occur multiple times in the
execution path.

[[sec:format1]]
=== Format 1 packets

This packet includes branch information, and is used when either the
branch information must be reported (for example because the branch map
is full), or when the address of an instruction must be reported, and
there has been at least one branch since the previous packet. If
included, the address is in differential format unless full address mode
is enabled (see <<sec:full-address>>).

==== Format 1 *updiscon* field

See <<sec:updiscon>>.

==== Format 1 *branch_map* field

When the branch map becomes full it must be reported, but in most cases
there is no need to report an address. This is indicated by setting
*branches* to 0. The exception to this is when the instruction
immediately prior to the final branch causes an uninferable
discontinuity, in which case *branches* is set to 31.

The choice of sizes (1, 3, 7, 15, 31) is designed to minimize efficiency
loss. On average there will be some 'wasted' bits because the number of
branches to report is less than the selected size of the *branch_map*
field. Using a tapered set of sizes means that the number of wasted bits
will on average be less for shorter packets. If the number of branches
between updiscons is randomly distributed then the probability of
generating packets with large branch counts will be lower, in which case
increased waste for longer packets will have less overall impact.
Furthermore, the rate at which packets are generated can be higher for
lower branch counts, and so reducing waste for this case will improve
overall bandwidth at times where it is most important.

[[sec:format0]]
=== Format 0 packets

This format is intended for optional efficiency extensions. Currently
two extensions are defined, for reporting counts of correctly predicted
branches, and for reporting the jump target cache index.

If branch prediction is supported and is enabled, then there is a choice
of whether to output a full branch map (via format 1), or a count of
correctly predicted branches. The count format is used if the number of
correctly predicted branches is at least 31. If there are 31 unreported
branches (i.e. the branch map is full), but not all of them were
predicted correctly, then the branch map will be output. A branch count
will be output under the following conditions:

* A branch is mis-predicted. The count value will be the number of
correctly predicted branches, minus 31. No address information is
provided - it is implicitly that of the branch which failed prediction;
* An updiscon, interrupt or exception requires the encoder to output an
address. In this case the encoder will output the branch count (number
of correctly predicted branches, minus 31);
* The branch count reaches its maximum value. Strictly speaking an
address isn't required for this case, but is included to avoid having to
distinguish the packet format from the case above. It will occur so
rarely that the bandwidth impact can be ignored.

If a jump target cache is supported and enabled, and the address to
report following an updiscon is in the cache then the encoder can output
the cache index using format 0, subformat 1. However, the encoder may
still choose to output the differential address using format 1 or 2 if
the resulting packet is shorter. This may occur if the differential
address is zero, or very small.

[[sec:f0s]]
==== Format 0 subformat field

The width of this field depends on the number of optional formats
supported. Currently, two optional formats are defined (correctly
predicted branches and jump target cache). The width is specified by the
_f0s_width_ discovery field (see <<sec:disco>>). If
multiple optional formats are supported, the field width must be
non-zero. However, if only one optional format is supported, the field
can be omitted, and the value of the field inferred from the *options*
field in the support packet (see <<sec:format33>>. This
provision allows additional formats to be added in future without
reducing the efficiency of the existing formats.

==== Format 0 *branch_fmt* field

This is encoded so that when no address is required it will be zero,
allowing the upper bits of the *branch_count* field to be compressed
away.

When a branch count is reported without an address it is because a
branch has failed the prediction. However, when an address is reported
along with a branch count, it will be because the packet was initiated
by an uninferable discontinuity, an exception, or because a branch has
been encountered that increments *branch_count* to 0xffff_ffff. For the
latter case, the reported address will always be for a branch, and in
the former cases it may be. If it is a branch, it is necessary to be
explicit about whether or not the prediction was met or not. If it is
met, then the reported address is that of the last correctly predicted
branch.

==== Format 0 *irreport* and *irdepth* fields

These bits are encoded so that most of the time they will take the same
value as the immediately preceding bit (*updiscon*, *branch_map[MSB]* or
*branches[MSB]* depending on the specific packet format). Purpose and
behavior is as described in <<sec:irxx>>.

For the jump target cache (subformat 1), they are included to allow
return addresses that fail the implicit return prediction but which
reside in the jump target cache to be reported using this format. An
implementation could omit these if all implicit return failures are
reported using format 1.
